<section title="Introduction">

    <t>
Based on time, resource reservation, and policy enforcement by distributed
shapers, Deterministic Networking provides the capability to carry specified
unicast or multicast data streams for real-time applications with extremely low
data loss rates and bounded latency, so as to support time-sensitive and
mission-critical applications on a converged enterprise infrastructure.
    </t>

    <t>
Deterministic Networking in the IP world is an attempt to eliminate packet loss
for a committed bandwidth while ensuring a worst case end-to-end latency,
regardless of the network conditions and across technologies. It can be seen as
a set of new Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees of worst-case delivery. IP
networks become more deterministic when the effects of statistical multiplexing
(jitter and collision loss) are mostly eliminated. This requires a tight control
of the physical resources to maintain the amount of traffic within the physical
capabilities of the underlying technology, e.g., by the use of time-shared
resources (bandwidth and buffers) per circuit, and/or by shaping and/or
scheduling the packets at every hop.
    </t>

    <t>
Key attributes of Deterministic Networking include:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>time synchronization on all the nodes,</t>
        <t>centralized computation of network-wide deterministic paths,</t>
        <t>multi-technology path with co-channel interference minimzation, and</t>
        <t>new traffic shapers within and at the edge to protect the network.</t>
      </list>

    </t>

    <t>
Wireless operates on a shared medium, and transmissions cannot be fully
deterministic due to uncontrolled interferences, including self-induced
multipath fading. Scheduling transmissions enables to alleviate those effects by
leveraging diversity in the spatial, time and frequency domains, enabling
Scheduled Predictable and Available Wireless Networks (PAW).

    </t>

    <t>
The wireless and wired media are fundamentally different at the physical level,
and while the generic Problem Statement <xref
target="I-D.ietf-detnet-problem-statement"/> for DetNet applies to the wired as
well as the wireless medium, the methods to achieve PAW necessarily differ from
those used to support Time-Sensitive Networking over wires.
    </t>

    <t>
So far, Open Standards for Deterministic Networking have prevalently been
focused on wired media, with Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Time Sensitive
Networking (TSN) at the IEEE and DetNet <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> at the IETF. But wires cannot be used in
a number of cases, including mobile or rotating devices, rehabilitated 
industrial buildings, wearable or in-body sensory devices, vehicle 
automation and	multiplayer gaming.
    </t>

    <t>
Purpose-built wireless technologies such as <xref target="ISA100"/>, which
incorporates IPv6, were developped and deployed to cope for the lack of open
standards, but they yield a high cost in OPEX and CAPEX and are limited to
very few industries, e.g., process control, concert instruments or racing. 
    </t>

    <t>
This is now changing:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
IMT-2020 has recognized Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication
(URLLC) as a key functionality for the upcoming 5G,
        </t>

      <!--
      <t>IEEE 802.11 is integrating real-time applications in the charter of
	   the	Extreme High Throughput (EHT) Task Group (to be formed at the time
	   of this writing), and</t>
	   -->

        <t>
IEEE 802.11 has identified a set of real-applications <xref
target="ieee80211-rt-tig"/> which may use the IEEE802.11 standards. They
typically emphasize strict end-to-end delay requirements.
        </t>

        <t>
the IETF has produced an IPv6 stack for IEEE Std. 802.15.4 TimeSlotted Channel
Hopping (TSCH) and an architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/>
that enables Scheduled Predictable and Available Wireless Networks (PAW) on a
shared MAC.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
This draft extends the <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases">
"Deterministic Networking Use Cases"</xref> and describes a number of
additional use cases which require deterministic flows over wireless links
and possibly complex multi-hop paths called Tracks. This is covered mainly by the "Wireless for Industrial Applications" use case, as the "Cellular Radio" is mostly dedicated to the (wired) transport part of a Radio Access Network (RAN). Whereas the "Wireless for Industrial Applications" use case certainly covers an area of interest for PAW, it is limited to 6TiSCH, and thus its scope is narrower than the use cases described next in this document.

   <section title="Use Case Description">

      <t>
The digitalization of Amusement Parks is expected to decrease significantly the
cost for maintaining the attractions. By monitoring in real-time the machines,
predictive maintenance will help to reduce the repairing cost as well as the
downtime. Besides, the attractions may use wireless transmissions to
interconnect sensors and actuators, to privileged reconfigurability, and
standardization.
      </t>
      
      <t>
Attractions may comprise a large set of sensors and actuators, which react in
real time. Typical applications comprise:
      </t>

      <t>
         <list style="symbols">
            <t>
emergency: safety has to be preserved, and MUST stop the attraction when a
failure is detected;
            </t>

            <t>
video: augmented and virtual realities are integrated in the attraction. Some
wearable devices (e.g. glasses, virtual reality headset) need to oflload one
part of the processing tasks.
            </t>

            <t>
real-time interactions: visitors may interact with the attraction, like in a
real-time video game. The vistors may virtually interact with their environment,
triggering actions in the real world (through actuators) <xref target="robots"/>
            </t>

            <t>
geolocation: vistors are tracked with a personal wireless tag so that their user
experience is improved.
            </t>

            <t>
predictive maintenance: statistics are collected to predict the future failures,
or to compute later more complex statistics about the attraction's usage, the
downtime, its popularity, etc.
            </t>

         </list>

      </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Specificities">

      <t>
Amusement parks comprise a variable number of attractions, mostly outdoor, over
a large geographical area. The IT infrastrcuture is typically multi-scale:

         <list style="symbols">

            <t>
local area: the sensors and actuators controling the attractions are co-located.
Control loops trigger only local traffic, with a small end-to-end delay,
typically inferior than 10 milliseconds, like classical industrial systems <xref
target="ieee80211-rt-tig"/>
               </t>

            <t>
wearable devices are free to move in the park. They exchange traffic locally
(identification, personalization, multimedia) or globally (billing child
tracking);
               </t>

            <t>
a cloud may be required for cloud gaming to offload one part of the processing,
predictive maintenance for data analytics.

    <section title="The Need for Wireless">

        <t>
Amusement parks cover large areas and a global interconnection would require a
huge length of cables. Wireless also optimizes the reconfigurability, enabling
to update cheaply the attractions. The frequent renewal helps to increase
customer loyalty.
      </t>

        <t>
Some parts of the attraction are mobile, e.g. trucks of a rollercoaster, robots.
Since cables are prone to frequent failures in this situation, wireless
transmissions are recommended.
        </t>

        <t>
Wearable devices are extensively used for a user experience personalisation.
They typically need to support wireless transmissions. Personal tags may help to
reduce the operating costs <xref target="disney-VIP"/> and to increase the
number of charged services provided to the audience (VIP tickets, interactivity,
etc.) Some applications rely on more sophisticated wearable devices such as
digital glasses or VR headests for an immersive experience.
        </t>

    </section> <!-- title="The Need for Wireless" -->

    <section title="Requirements for RAW">
        <t>
The network infrastructure has to support heterogenous traffic, with very
different criticalities. Thus, flow isolation has to be provided.
        </t>

        <t>
We have to schedule appropriately the transmissions, even in presence of mobile
devices. While the <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/> already
proposes an architecture for synchronized, IEEE Std. 802.15.4 Time-Slotted
Channel Hopping (TSCH) networks, 6TiSCH focused on best-effort IPv6 flows. RAW
might provide mechanisms helping to automatically adapt the network (i.e., schedule appropriately the transmissions, accross hetereogeneous technologies, with strict SLA requirements).
           </t>

        <t>
Nowadays, long-range wireless transmissions are used for best-effort traffic,
and <xref target="IEEE802.1TSN"/> is used for critical flows using Ethernet
devices. However, we need an IP enabled technology to interconnect large areas,
independent of the PHY and MAC layer to maximize the compliancy.
           </t>

        <t>
We expect to deploy several different technologies (long vs. short range) which
have to cohabit in the same area. Thus, we need to schedule appropriately the
transmissions to limit the co-technology interference, so that an end-to-end
delay accross multiple technologies can be guaranteed. It is needed to understand which technologies PAW will cover and how they can be used cohabitating in the same area.

<section title="Wireless for Industrial Applications">
   
   <section title="Use Case Description">
    <t> 
A major use case for networking in Industrial is the control networks where
periodic control loops operate between a sensor that measures a physical
property such as the temperature of a fluid, a Programmable Logic Controller
that decides an action such as warm up the mix, and an actuator that performs
the required action, e.g., inject power in a resistor.
    </t>

   </section>    

   <section anchor="indusspecif" title="Specificities">    

     <section anchor="indusloops" title="Control Loops">

    <t>
Process Control designates continous processing operations, e.g., heating Oil in
a refinery or mixing drinking soda. Control loops in the Process Control
industry operate at a very low rate, typically 4 times per second. Factory
Automation, on the other hand, deal with discrete goods such as individual
automobile parts, and requires faster loops, in the order of 10ms. Motion
control that monitors dynamic activities may require even faster rates in the
order of a few ms. Finally, some industries exhibit hybrid behaviours, like
canned soup that will start as a process industry while mixing the food and then
operate as a discrete manufacturing when putting the final product in cans and
shipping them. 
   </t>

    <t>
In all those cases, a packet must flow deterministically between the sensor and
the PLC, be processed by the PLC, and sent to the actuator within the control
loop period. In some particular use cases that inherit from analog operations,
jitter might also alter the operation of the control loop. A rare packet loss is
usually admissible, but typically 4 losses in a row will cause an emergency halt
of the production and incur a high cost for the manufacturer.
    </t> 

    </section><!--"Control Loops"-->

   <section anchor="indusdiags" title="Unmeasured Data">   
   <t>
   A secondary use case deals with monitoring and diagnostics. This so-called unmeasured data is essential to improve the performances of a production
   line, e.g., by optimizing real-time processing or maintenance windows using
   Machine Learning predictions. For the lack of wireless technologies, some
   specific industries such as Oil and Gas have been using serial cables,
   literally by the millions, to perform their process optimization over the
   previous decades. But few industries would afford the associated cost and
   the Holy Grail of the Industrial Internet of Things is to provide the same
   benefits to all industries, including SmartGrid, Transportation, Building,
   Commercial and Medical. This requires a cheap, available and scalable
   IP-based access technology.
   </t>

   <t>
   Inside the factory, wires may already be available to operate the Control
   Network. But unmeasured data are not welcome in that network for a number of
   reasons. On the one hand it is rich and asynchronous, meaning that using they
   may influence the deterministic nature of the control operations and impact
   the production. On the other hand, this information must be reported to the
   carpeted floor over IP, which means the potential for a security breach via
   the interconnection of the Operational Technology (OT) network with the
   Internet technology (IT) network and possibly enable a rogue access.

   <section title="The Need for Wireless"> 
   <t>
   Ethernet cables used on a robot arm are prone to breakage after a few
   thousands flexions, a lot faster than a power cable that is wider inn diameter, and more resilient. In general, wired networking and mobile parts
   are not a good match, mostly in the case of fast and recurrent activities, as
   well as rotation.
   </t>
   <t>
   When refurbishing older premises that were built before the Internet age,
   power is usually available everywhere, but data is not. It is often 
   impractical, time consuming and expensive to deploy an Ethernet fabric
   across walls and between buildings. Deploying a wire may take months and
   cost tens of thousands of US Dollars.
   </t>
   <t>
   Even when wiring exists, e.g., in an existing control network, asynchronous
   IP packets such as diagnostics may not be welcome for operational and
   security reasons (see <xref target="indusloops" />). An alternate network
   that can scale with the many sensors and actuators that equip every robot, 
   every valve and fan that are deployed on the factory floor and may help 
   detect and prevent a failure that could impact the production.
   IEEE Std. 802.15.4 Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH)
   <xref target="RFC7554"/> is a promising technology for that purpose, mostly
   if the scheduled operations enable to use the same network by asynchronous
   and deterministic flows in parallel.

   <section title="Requirements for RAW">

    <t>
As stated by the <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-problem-statement">
"Deterministic Networking Problem Statement" </xref>, a Deterministic Network is
backwards compatible with (capable of transporting) statistically multiplexed
traffic while preserving the properties of the accepted deterministic flows.
While the <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/> serves that requirement,
the work at 6TiSCH was focused on best-effort IPv6 packet flows. RAW should be
able to lock so-called hard cells for use by a centralized scheduler, and
program so-called end-to-end Tracks over those cells.
    </t>

    <t>
Over the course of the recent years, major Industrial Protocols, e.g., <xref
target="ODVA"/> with EtherNet/IP <xref target="EIP"/> and <xref
target="Profinet"/>, have been migrating towards Ethernet and IP. In order to
unleash the full power of the IP hourglass model, it should be possible to
deploy any application over any network that has the physical capacity to
transport the industrial flow, regardless of the MAC/PHY technology, wired or
wireless, and across technologies. RAW mechanisms should be able to setup a
Track over a wireless access segment such as TSCH and a backbone segment such as
Ethernet or WI-Fi, to report a sensor data or a critical monitoring within a
bouded latency.

   <section title="The Need for Wireless"> 

    <t>
It is clear that gaming is evolving towards wireless, as players demand being able to play anywhere. Besides, the industry is changing towards playing from mobile phones, which are inherently connected via wireless technologies.

Time sensitive networking extensions. Extensions, such as time-aware shaping and redundancy (FRE) can be explored to address congestion and reliability problems present in wireless networks.
        </t>

        <t>
Priority tagging (Stream identification). One basic requirement to provide better QoS for time-sensitive traffic is the capability to identify and differentiate time-sensitive packets from other (e.g. best-effort) traffic. 
        </t>

        <t>
Time-aware shaping. This capability (defined in IEEE 802.1Qbv) consists of gates to control the opening/closing of queues that share a common egress port within an Ethernet switch. A scheduler defines the times when each queue opens or close, therefore eliminating congestion and ensuring that frames are delivered within the expected latency bounds.
        </t>

        <t>
Dual/multiple link. Due to the competitions and interference are common and hardly in control under wireless network, in order to improve the latency stability, dual/multiple link proposal is brought up to address this issue. Two modes are defined: duplicate and joint.
        </t>

        <t>
Admission Control. Congestion is a major cause of high/variable latency and it is well known that if the traffic load exceeds the capability of the link, QoS will be degraded. QoS degradation maybe acceptable for many applications today, however emerging time-sensitive applications are highly susceptible to increased latency and jitter. In order to better control QoS, it is important to control access to the network resources.

<section title="UAV platooning and control">

   <section title="Use Case Description">

      <t>
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular for many different
applications, including military and civil use cases. The term drone is commonly
used to refer to a UAV.
      </t>

      <t>
UAVs can be used to perform aerial surveillance activities, traffic monitoring
(e.g., Spanish traffic control has recently introduced a fleet of drones for
quicker reactions upon traffic congestion related events), support of emergency
situations, and even transportation of small goods.
      </t>

      <t>
UAVs typically have various forms of wireless connectivity:
      </t>

      <t>

         <list style="symbols">

            <t>cellular: for communication with the control center, for remote
manuevering as well as monitoring of the drone;
            </t>

            <t>IEEE 802.11: for inter-drone communications (e.g., platooning)
and providing connectivity to other devices (e.g., acting as Access Point).
            </t>

         </list>

      </t>

   </section>

   <section title="Specificities">

      <t>
Some of the use cases/tasks involving drones require coordination among drones.
Others involve complex compute tasks that might not be performed using the
limited computing resources that a drone typically has. These two aspects
require continuous connectivity with the control center and among drones.
      </t>

      <t>
Remote manouvering of a drone might be performed over a cellular network in some
cased, however, there are situations that need very low latencies and
deterministic behaviour of the connectivity. Examples involve platooning of
drones or share of computing resources among drones (e.g., a drone offload some
function to a neighbouring drone).
      </t>

   </section>

   <section title="The Need for Wireless">

        <t>
UAVs cannot be connected through any type of wired media, so it is obvious that
wireless is needed.
        </t>

   </section> <!-- title="The Need for Wireless" -->

   <section title="Requirements for RAW">

        <t>
The network infrastructure is actually composed by the UAVs themselves,
requiring self-configuration capabilities.
        </t>

        <t>
Heterogeneous types of traffic need to be supported, from extremely critical
ones requiring ultra low latency and high resiliency, to traffic requiring
low-medium latency.
        </t>

        <t>
When a given service is decomposed into functions -- hosted at different drones
-- chained, each link connecting two given functions would have a well-defined
set of requirements (latency, bandwith and jitter) that have to be met.

<section title="Edge Robotics control">

   <section title="Use Case Description">

      <t>
The Edge Robotics scenario consists of several robots, deployed in a given area
(for example a shopping mall), inter-connected via an access network to a
network's edge device or a data center. The robots are connected to the edge so
complex computational activities are not executed locally at the robots, but
offloaded to the edge. This brings additional flexibility in the type of tasks
that the robots do, as well as reducing the costs of robot manufacturing (due to
their lower complexity), and enabling complex tasks involving coordination among
robots (that can be more easily performed if robots are centrally controlled).
      </t>

      <t>
A simple example of the use of multiples robots is cleaning, delivering of goods
from warehouses to shops or video surveillance. Multiple robots are
simultaneously instructed to perform individual tasks by moving the robotic
intelligence from the robots to the network's edge (e.g., data center). That
enables easy synchronization, scalable solution and on-demand option to create
flexible fleet of robots.
      </t>

      <t>
Robots would have various forms of wireless connectivity:

      <t>
         <list style="symbols">

            <t>IEEE 802.11: for connection to the edge and also inter-robot communications (e.g.,  for coordinated actions);
            </t>

            <t>cellular: as an additional communication link to the edge, though primarily as backup, since ultra low latencies are needed.
            </t>

         </list>

      </t>

   </section>

   <section title="Specificities">

      <t>
Some of the use cases/tasks involving robots might benefit from decomposition of
a service in small functions that are distributed and chained among robots and
the edge. These require continuous connectivity with the control center and
among drones.
      </t>

      <t>
Robot control is an activity requiring very low latencies between the robot and
the location where the control intelligence resides (which might be the edge or
another robot).
      </t>

   </section>

   <section title="The Need for Wireless">

        <t>
Deploying robots in scenarios such as shopping malls for the aforementioned
applications cannot be done via wired connectivity.

robot control to video streaming.
