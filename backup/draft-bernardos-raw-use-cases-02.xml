<section title="Introduction">

    <t>
Based on time, resource reservation, and policy enforcement by distributed
shapers, Deterministic Networking provides the capability to carry specified
unicast or multicast data streams for real-time applications with extremely low
data loss rates and bounded latency, so as to support time-sensitive and
mission-critical applications on a converged enterprise infrastructure.
    </t>

    <t>
Deterministic Networking in the IP world is an attempt to eliminate packet loss
for a committed bandwidth while ensuring a worst case end-to-end latency,
regardless of the network conditions and across technologies. It can be seen as
a set of new Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees of worst-case delivery. IP
networks become more deterministic when the effects of statistical multiplexing
(jitter and collision loss) are mostly eliminated. This requires a tight control
of the physical resources to maintain the amount of traffic within the physical
capabilities of the underlying technology, e.g., by the use of time-shared
resources (bandwidth and buffers) per circuit, and/or by shaping and/or scheduling
the packets at every hop.
    </t>

    <t>
Key attributes of Deterministic Networking include:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>time synchronization on all the nodes,</t>
        <t>centralized computation of network-wide deterministic paths,</t>
        <t>multi-technology path with co-channel interference minimization,</t>
        <t>frame preemption and guard time mechanisms to ensure a worst-case delay, and</t>
        <t>new traffic shapers within and at the edge to protect the network.</t>
      </list>

    </t>

    <t>
Wireless operates on a shared medium, and transmissions cannot be fully
deterministic due to uncontrolled interferences, including self-induced
multipath fading. RAW (Reliable and Available Wireless) is an effort to provide
Deterministic Networking on across a path that include a wireless physical
layer. Making Wireless Reliable and Available is even more challenging than it
is with wires, due to the numerous causes of loss in transmission that add up to
the congestion losses and the delays caused by overbooked shared resources.
    </t>

    <t>
The wireless and wired media are fundamentally different at the physical level,
and while the generic Problem Statement <xref target="RFC8557"/> for DetNet
applies to the wired as well as the wireless medium, the methods to achieve RAW
necessarily differ from those used to support Time-Sensitive Networking over
wires.
    </t>

    <t>
So far, Open Standards for Deterministic Networking have prevalently been
focused on wired media, with Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Time Sensitive
Networking (TSN) at the IEEE and DetNet <xref
target="RFC8655"/> at the IETF. But wires cannot be used in
a number of cases, including mobile or rotating devices, rehabilitated
industrial buildings, wearable or in-body sensory devices, vehicle automation
and multiplayer gaming.
    </t>

    <t>
Purpose-built wireless technologies such as <xref target="ISA100"/>, which
incorporates IPv6, were developped and deployed to cope for the lack of open
standards, but they yield a high cost in OPEX and CAPEX and are limited to
very few industries, e.g., process control, concert instruments or racing. 
    </t>

    <t>
This is now changing <xref target="I-D.thubert-raw-technologies"/>:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>
IMT-2020 has recognized Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) as a
key functionality for the upcoming 5G.
        </t>

      <!--
      <t>IEEE 802.11 is integrating real-time applications in the charter of
	   the	Extreme High Throughput (EHT) Task Group (to be formed at the time
	   of this writing), and</t>
	   -->

        <t>
IEEE 802.11 has identified a set of real-applications <xref
target="ieee80211-rt-tig"/> which may use the IEEE802.11 standards. They
typically emphasize strict end-to-end delay requirements.
        </t>

        <t>
The IETF has produced an IPv6 stack for IEEE Std. 802.15.4 TimeSlotted Channel
Hopping (TSCH) and an architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/>
that enables Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) on a shared MAC.
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
This draft extends the "Deterministic Networking Use Cases" document <xref
target="RFC8578"/> and describes a number of additional use cases which require
"reliable/predictable and available" flows over wireless links and possibly
complex multi-hop paths called Tracks. This is covered mainly by the "Wireless
for Industrial Applications" use case, as the "Cellular Radio" is mostly
dedicated to the (wired) transport part of a Radio Access Network (RAN). Whereas
the "Wireless for Industrial Applications" use case certainly covers an area of
interest for RAW, it is limited to 6TiSCH, and thus its scope is narrower than
the use cases described next in this document.

<section title="Aeronautical Communications">
    <t>
Aircraft are currently connected to ATC (Air-Traffic Control) and AOC (Airline
Operational Control) via voice and data communications systems through all
phases of a flight. Within the airport terminal, connectivity is focused on high
bandwidth communications while during en-route high reliability, robustness and
range is the main focus.
    </t>

    <section title="Problem Statement">
        <t>
Worldwide civil air traffic is expected to grow by 84% until 2040 compared to
2017 <xref target="EURO20"/>. Thus, legacy systems in air traffic management
(ATM) are likely to reach their capacity limits and the need for new
aeronautical communication technologies becomes apparent. Especially problematic
is the saturation of VHF band in high density areas in Europe, the US, and Asia
<xref target="KEAV20"/> <xref target="FAA20"/> calling for suitable new digital
approaches such as AeroMACS for airport communications, SatCOM for remote
domains, and LDACS as long-range terrestrial aeronautical communications system.
Making the frequency spectrum's usage more efficient a transition from analogue
voice to digital data communication <xref target="PLA14"/> is necessary to cope
with the expected growth of civil aviation and its supporting infrastructure. A
promising candidate for long range terrestrial communications, already in the
process of being standardized in the International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO), is the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS) <xref
target="ICAO18"/> <xref target="I-D.maeurer-raw-ldacs" format="default"/>.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Specifics">
        <t>
During the creation process of new communications system, analogue voice is
replaced by digital data communication. This sets a paradigm shift from analogue
to digital wireless communications and supports the related trend towards
increased autonomous data processing that the Future Communications
Infrastructure (FCI) in civil aviation must provide. The FCI is depicted in

    <section title="Challenges">
        <t>
This paradigm change brings a lot of new challenges:

          <list style="symbols">

            <t>
Efficiency: It is necessary to keep latency, time and data overhead (routing,
security) of new aeronautical datalinks at a minimum.
            </t>

            <t>
Modularity: Systems in avionics usually operate up to 30 years, thus solutions
must be modular, easily adaptable and updatable.
            </t>

            <t>
Interoperability: All 192 members of the international Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) must be able to use these solutions.
            </t>

          </list>

        </t>

    </section>

    <section title="The Need for Wireless">
        <t>
In a high mobility environment such as aviation, the envisioned solutions to
provide worldwide coverage of data connections with in-flight aircraft require a
multi-system, multi-link, multi-hop approach. Thus air, ground and space based
datalink providing technologies will have to operate seamlessly together to cope
with the increasing needs of data exchange between aircraft, air traffic
controller, airport infrastructure, airlines, air network service providers
(ANSPs) and so forth. Thus making use of wireless technologies is a must in
tackling this enormous need for a worldwide digital aeronautical datalink
infrastructure.
        </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements for RAW">

        <t>
Different safety levels need to be supported, from extremely safety critical
ones requiring low latency, such as a WAKE warning - a warning that two aircraft
come dangerously close to each other - and high resiliency, to less safety
critical ones requiring low-medium latency for services such as WXGRAPH -
graphical weather data.
        </t>

        <t>
Overhead needs to be kept at a minimum since aeronautical data links provide
comparatively small data rates in the order of kbit/s.
        </t>

        <t>
Policy needs to be supported when selecting data links. The focus of RAW here
should be on the selectors, responsible for the routing path a packet takes to
reach its end destination. This would minimize the amount of routing information
that has to travel inside the network because of precomputed routing tables with
the selector being responsible for choosing the most appropriate option
according to policy and safety.

<section title="Amusement Parks">
   
   <section title="Use Case Description">

      <t>
The digitalization of Amusement Parks is expected to decrease significantly the
cost for maintaining the attractions. By monitoring in real-time the machines,
predictive maintenance will help to reduce the repairing cost as well as the
downtime. Besides, the attractions may use wireless transmissions to
interconnect sensors and actuators, to privilege reconfigurability, and
standardization.
      </t>
      
      <t>
Attractions may rely on a large set of sensors and actuators, which react in
real time. Typical applications comprise:
      </t>

      <t>
         <list style="symbols">
            <t>
Emergency: safety has to be preserved, and must stop the attraction when a
failure is detected.
            </t>

            <t>
Video: augmented and virtual realities are integrated in the attraction. Wearable
devices (e.g., glasses, virtual reality headset) need to offload one part of the
processing tasks.
            </t>

            <t>
Real-time interactions: visitors may interact with an attraction, like in a
real-time video game. The visitors may virtually interact with their environment,
triggering actions in the real world (through actuators) <xref target="robots"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
Geolocation: visitors are tracked with a personal wireless tag so that their user
experience is improved.
            </t>

            <t>
Predictive maintenance: statistics are collected to predict the future failures,
or to compute later more complex statistics about the attraction's usage, the
downtime, its popularity, etc.

   </section>

   <section title="Specifics">

      <t>
Amusement parks comprise a variable number of attractions, mostly outdoor, over
a large geographical area. The IT infrastructure is typically multi-scale:

         <list style="symbols">

            <t>
Local area: the sensors and actuators controlling the attractions are co-located.
Control loops trigger only local traffic, with a small end-to-end delay,
typically inferior than 10 milliseconds, like classical industrial systems <xref
target="ieee80211-rt-tig"/>.
               </t>

            <t>
Wearable devices are free to move in the park. They exchange traffic locally
(identification, personalization, multimedia) or globally (billing, child
tracking).
               </t>

            <t>
Computationally intensive applications offload some tasks to a cloud, and

    <section title="The Need for Wireless">

        <t>
Amusement parks cover large areas and a global interconnection would require a
huge length of cables. Wireless also increases the reconfigurability, enabling
to update cheaply the attractions. The frequent renewal helps to increase
customer loyalty.
      </t>

        <t>
Some parts of the attraction are mobile, e.g., trucks of a roller-coaster, robots.
Since cables are prone to frequent failures in this situation, wireless
transmissions are recommended.
        </t>

        <t>
Wearable devices are extensively used for a user experience personalization.
They typically need to support wireless transmissions. Personal tags may help to
reduce the operating costs <xref target="disney-VIP"/> and to increase the
number of charged services provided to the audience (VIP tickets, interactivity,
etc.) Some applications rely on more sophisticated wearable devices such as
digital glasses or Virtual Reality (VR) headsets for an immersive experience.

    </section> <!-- title="The Need for Wireless" -->

    <section title="Requirements for RAW">
        <t>
The network infrastructure has to support heterogeneous traffic, with very
different critical requirements. Thus, flow isolation has to be provided.
        </t>

        <t>
We have to schedule appropriately the transmissions, even in presence of mobile
devices. While the <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/> already
proposes an architecture for synchronized, IEEE Std. 802.15.4 Time-Slotted
Channel Hopping (TSCH) networks, 6TiSCH does not address real-time IPv6 flows.
RAW might provide mechanisms helping to automatically adapt the network (i.e.,
schedule appropriately the transmissions, across heterogeneous technologies,
with strict SLA requirements).
           </t>

        <t>
Nowadays, long-range wireless transmissions are used for best-effort traffic,
and <xref target="IEEE802.1TSN"/> is used for critical flows using Ethernet
devices. However, we need an IP enabled technology to interconnect large areas,
independent of the PHY and MAC layer to maximize the compliancy.
           </t>

        <t>
We expect to deploy several different technologies (long vs. short range) which
have to cohabit in the same area. Thus, we need to schedule appropriately the
transmissions to limit the co-technology interference, so that an end-to-end
delay across multiple technologies can be guaranteed. It is needed to understand
which technologies RAW will cover and how they can be used cohabitating in the
same area.

<section title="Wireless for Industrial Applications">
   
   <section title="Use Case Description">
    <t> 
A major use case for networking in Industrial environments is the control
networks where periodic control loops operate between a sensor that measures a
physical property such as the temperature of a fluid, a Programmable Logic
Controller (PLC) that decides an action such as warm up the mix, and an actuator
that performs the required action, e.g., inject power in a resistor.

     <section anchor="indusloops" title="Control Loops">

    <t>
Process Control designates continuous processing operations, e.g., heating Oil
in a refinery or mixing drinking soda. Control loops in the Process Control
industry operate at a very low rate, typically 4 times per second. Factory
Automation, on the other hand, deal with discrete goods such as individual
automobile parts, and requires faster loops, in the order of 10ms. Motion
control that monitors dynamic activities may require even faster rates in the
order of a few ms. Finally, some industries exhibit hybrid behaviors, like
canned soup that will start as a process industry while mixing the food and then
operate as a discrete manufacturing when putting the final product in cans and
shipping them. 
   </t>

    <t>
In all those cases, a packet must flow reliably between the sensor and the PLC,
be processed by the PLC, and sent to the actuator within the control loop
period. In some particular use cases that inherit from analog operations, jitter
might also alter the operation of the control loop. A rare packet loss is
usually admissible, but typically 4 losses in a row will cause an emergency halt
of the production and incur a high cost for the manufacturer.

A secondary use case deals with monitoring and diagnostics. This so-called
unmeasured data is essential to improve the performances of a production line,
e.g., by optimizing real-time processing or maintenance windows using Machine
Learning predictions. For the lack of wireless technologies, some specific
industries such as Oil and Gas have been using serial cables, literally by the
millions, to perform their process optimization over the previous decades. But
few industries would afford the associated cost and the Holy Grail of the
Industrial Internet of Things is to provide the same benefits to all industries,
including SmartGrid, Transportation, Building, Commercial and Medical. This
requires a cheap, available and scalable IP-based access technology.
   </t>

   <t>
Inside the factory, wires may already be available to operate the Control
Network. But unmeasured data are not welcome in that network for a number of
reasons. On the one hand it is rich and asynchronous, meaning that using they
may influence the deterministic nature of the control operations and impact the
production. On the other hand, this information must be reported to the carpeted
floor over IP, which means the potential for a security breach via the
interconnection of the Operational Technology (OT) network with the Internet
technology (IT) network and possibly enable a rogue access.

   <t>
Ethernet cables used on a robot arm are prone to breakage after a few thousands
flexions, a lot faster than a power cable that is wider inn diameter, and more
resilient. In general, wired networking and mobile parts are not a good match,
mostly in the case of fast and recurrent activities, as well as rotation.
   </t>

   <t>
When refurbishing older premises that were built before the Internet age, power
is usually available everywhere, but data is not. It is often impractical, time
consuming and expensive to deploy an Ethernet fabric across walls and between
buildings. Deploying a wire may take months and cost tens of thousands of US
Dollars.
   </t>

   <t>
Even when wiring exists, e.g., in an existing control network, asynchronous IP
packets such as diagnostics may not be welcome for operational and security
reasons (see <xref target="indusloops" />). An alternate network that can scale
with the many sensors and actuators that equip every robot, every valve and fan
that are deployed on the factory floor and may help detect and prevent a failure
that could impact the production. IEEE Std. 802.15.4 Time-Slotted Channel
Hopping (TSCH) <xref target="RFC7554"/> is a promising technology for that
purpose, mostly if the scheduled operations enable to use the same network by
asynchronous and deterministic flows in parallel.
   </t>

   </section> <!-- title="The Need for Wireless" --> 

   <section title="Requirements for RAW">

    <t>
As stated by the <xref target="RFC8557"> "Deterministic Networking Problem
Statement" </xref>, a Deterministic Network is backwards compatible with
(capable of transporting) statistically multiplexed traffic while preserving the
properties of the accepted deterministic flows. While the <xref
target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/> serves that requirement, the work at
6TiSCH was focused on best-effort IPv6 packet flows. RAW should be able to lock
so-called hard cells for use by a centralized scheduler, and program so-called
end-to-end Tracks over those cells.
    </t>

    <t>
Over the course of the recent years, major Industrial Protocols, e.g., <xref
target="ODVA"/> with EtherNet/IP <xref target="EIP"/> and <xref
target="Profinet"/>, have been migrating towards Ethernet and IP. In order to
unleash the full power of the IP hourglass model, it should be possible to
deploy any application over any network that has the physical capacity to
transport the industrial flow, regardless of the MAC/PHY technology, wired or
wireless, and across technologies. RAW mechanisms should be able to setup a
Track over a wireless access segment such as TSCH and a backbone segment such as
Ethernet or WI-Fi, to report a sensor data or a critical monitoring within a
bounded latency.

<section title="Pro Audio and Video">
   
   <section title="Use Case Description">
    <t>
Many devices support audio and video streaming by employing 802.11 wireless LAN.
Some of these applications require low latency capability. For instance, when
the application provides interactive play, or when the audio takes plays in real
time (i.e. live) for public addresses in train stations or in theme parks.

    <section title="Uninterrupted Stream Playback">
      <t>
Considering the uninterrupted audio or video stream, a potential packet losses
during the transmission of audio or video flows cannot be tackled by re-trying
the transmission, as it is done with file transfer, because by the time the
packet lost has been identified it is too late to proceed with packet
re-transmission. Buffering might be employed to provide a certain delay which
will allow for one or more re-transmissions, however such approach is not
efficient in application where delays are not acceptable.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Synchronized Stream Playback">

      <t>
In the context of ProAV, latency is the time between the transmitted signal over
a stream and its reception. Thus, for sound to remain synchronized to the
movement in the video, the latency of both the audio and video streams must be
bounded and consistent.

<section title="Wireless Gaming">

   <section title="Use Case Description">

    <t> 
The gaming industry includes <xref target="IEEE80211RTA" /> real-time mobile
gaming, wireless console gaming and cloud gaming. For RAW, wireless console
gaming is the most relevant one. We next summarize the three:

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>
Real-time Mobile Gaming: Different from traditional games, real time mobile
gaming is very sensitive to network latency and stability. The mobile game can
connect multiple players together in a single game session and exchange data
messages between game server and connected players. Real-time means the feedback
should present on screen as users operate in game. For good game experience, the
end to end latency plus game servers processing time should not be noticed by
users as they play the game.
        </t>

        <t>
Wireless Console Gaming: Playing online on a console has 2 types of internet
connectivity, which is either wired or Wi-Fi. Most of the gaming consoles today
support Wi-Fi 5. But Wi-Fi has an especially bad reputation among the gaming
community. The main reasons are high latency, lag spikes and jitter.
        </t>

        <t>
Cloud Gaming: The cloud gaming requires low latency capability as the user
commands in a game session need to be sent back to the cloud server, the cloud
server would update game context depending on the received commands, and the
cloud server would render the picture/video to be displayed at user devices and
stream the picture/video content to the user devices. User devices might very
likely be connected wirelessly.

   </section>

   <section title="Specifics">

    <t> 
While a lot of details can be found on <xref target="IEEE80211RTA" />, we next
summarize the main requirements in terms of latency, jitter and packet loss:

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>
Intra BSS latency: less than 5 ms.
        </t>

        <t>
Jitter variance: less than 2 ms.
        </t>

        <t>
Packet loss: less than 0.1 percent.

   <section title="The Need for Wireless"> 

    <t>
It is clear that gaming is evolving towards wireless, as players demand being
able to play anywhere. Besides, the industry is changing towards playing from
mobile phones, which are inherently connected via wireless technologies.
    </t>

   </section> 
    
   <section title="Requirements for RAW">

    <t>

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>
Time sensitive networking extensions. Extensions, such as time-aware shaping and
redundancy (FRE) can be explored to address congestion and reliability problems
present in wireless networks.
        </t>

        <t>
Priority tagging (Stream identification). One basic requirement to provide
better QoS for time-sensitive traffic is the capability to identify and
differentiate time-sensitive packets from other (e.g. best-effort) traffic. 
        </t>

        <t>
Time-aware shaping. This capability (defined in IEEE 802.1Qbv) consists of gates
to control the opening/closing of queues that share a common egress port within
an Ethernet switch. A scheduler defines the times when each queue opens or
close, therefore eliminating congestion and ensuring that frames are delivered
within the expected latency bounds.
        </t>

        <t>
Dual/multiple link. Due to the competitions and interference are common and
hardly in control under wireless network, in order to improve the latency
stability, dual/multiple link proposal is brought up to address this issue. Two
modes are defined: duplicate and joint.
        </t>

        <t>
Admission Control. Congestion is a major cause of high/variable latency and it
is well known that if the traffic load exceeds the capability of the link, QoS
will be degraded. QoS degradation maybe acceptable for many applications today,
however emerging time-sensitive applications are highly susceptible to increased
latency and jitter. In order to better control QoS, it is important to control
access to the network resources.

<section title="UAV platooning and control">

   <section title="Use Case Description">

      <t>
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular for many different
applications, including military and civil use cases. The term drone is commonly
used to refer to a UAV.
      </t>

      <t>
UAVs can be used to perform aerial surveillance activities, traffic monitoring
(e.g., Spanish traffic control has recently introduced a fleet of drones for
quicker reactions upon traffic congestion related events), support of emergency
situations, and even transportation of small goods.
      </t>

      <t>
UAVs typically have various forms of wireless connectivity:
      </t>

      <t>

         <list style="symbols">

            <t>cellular: for communication with the control center, for remote
maneuvering as well as monitoring of the drone;
            </t>

            <t>IEEE 802.11: for inter-drone communications (e.g., platooning)
and providing connectivity to other devices (e.g., acting as Access Point).
            </t>

         </list>

      </t>

   </section>

   <section title="Specifics">

      <t>
Some of the use cases/tasks involving drones require coordination among drones.
Others involve complex compute tasks that might not be performed using the
limited computing resources that a drone typically has. These two aspects
require continuous connectivity with the control center and among drones.
      </t>

      <t>
Remote maneuvering of a drone might be performed over a cellular network in some
cased, however, there are situations that need very low latencies and
deterministic behavior of the connectivity. Examples involve platooning of
drones or share of computing resources among drones (e.g., a drone offload some
function to a neighboring drone).
      </t>

   </section>

   <section title="The Need for Wireless">

        <t>

ones requiring ultra low latency and high resiliency, to traffic requiring
low-medium latency.

<section title="Edge Robotics control">

   <section title="Use Case Description">

      <t>
The Edge Robotics scenario consists of several robots, deployed in a given area
(for example a shopping mall), inter-connected via an access network to a
network's edge device or a data center. The robots are connected to the edge so
complex computational activities are not executed locally at the robots, but
offloaded to the edge. This brings additional flexibility in the type of tasks
that the robots do, as well as reducing the costs of robot manufacturing (due to
their lower complexity), and enabling complex tasks involving coordination among
robots (that can be more easily performed if robots are centrally controlled).
      </t>

      <t>
A simple example of the use of multiples robots is cleaning, delivering of goods
from warehouses to shops or video surveillance. Multiple robots are
simultaneously instructed to perform individual tasks by moving the robotic
intelligence from the robots to the network's edge (e.g., data center). That
enables easy synchronization, scalable solution and on-demand option to create
flexible fleet of robots.

Cellular: as an additional communication link to the edge, though primarily as
backup, since ultra low latencies are needed.
