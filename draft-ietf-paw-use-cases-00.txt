1.  Introduction

   Based on time, resource reservation, and policy enforcement by
   distributed shapers, Deterministic Networking provides the capability
   to carry specified unicast or multicast data streams for real-time
   applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency,
   so as to support time-sensitive and mission-critical applications on
   a converged enterprise infrastructure.

   Deterministic Networking technology allows new Quality of Service
   (QoS) guarantees of worst-case delivery.  More precisely, the worst-
   case data loss and latency can be guaranteed in a consistent fashion
   as multiple services are deployed, augmenting the load of the network
   with no measurable impact on existing flows whatsoever.

   Key attributes of Deterministic Networking are:

      Time synchronization on all the nodes, often including source and
      destination

      The centralized computation of network-wide deterministic paths

      New traffic shapers within and at the edge to protect the network

      Specialized hardware for scheduled access to the media.

   So far, Open Standards for Deterministic Networking have prevalently
   been focused on wired media, with Audio/Video Bridgeing (AVB) and
   Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) at the IEEE and DetNet

   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] at the IETF.  But in a number of use-
   cases, wires can simplu not apply.  Examples include mobile or
   rotating devices, rehabilitated industrial buildings, wearable or in-
   body sensory devices, vehicle automation and multiplayer gaming.

   Purpose-built technologies [ISA100] [WirelessHART]have been deployed
   in the most critical cases to cope with the lack of open standards,
   but those yield a high cost in OPEX and CAPEX and are limited to very
   few industries, e.g., concerts and racing.  This is now changing.

      IMT-2020 has recognized Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication
      (URLLC)as a key functionality for the upcoming 5G.

      IEEE 802.11 is integrating real-time applications in the charter
      of the Extreme High Throughput (EHT) Task Group (to be formed at
      the time of this writing), and

      the IETF has designed an IPv6 stack [I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture]
      for IEEE Std. 802.15.4 TimeSlotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) and an
      architecture that enables Predictable and Available Wireless (PAW)
      communications on a shared MAC .

   Achieving Determinism requires a tight control of the physical
   resources, and at the physical level, wireless and wired are
   fundamentally different.  Wireless operates in a shared medium, and
   the quality of the transmission is fuzzy and depends of variable in
   the time, the spatial and the frequency domains.  It results that
   while the generic Problem Statement
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-problem-statement] for DetNet applies to the
   wireless medium as well as to wires, the methods to achieve
   Predictable and Available Wireless communications will necessarily
   differ from those used to support Time-Sensitive Networks in the
   wired environment.  The expectation is that PAW would centralize the
   work on efforts that inherit from DetNet but focus on wireless.

   This draft extends the "Deterministic Networking Use Cases"
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases] and describes a number of additional use
   cases which require deterministic flows over wireless links and
   possibly complex multi-hop paths.

2.  Pro Audio and Video

2.1.  Use Case Description

   The professional audio and video industry ("ProAV") includes:

   o  Gaming (e.g., Play Station, Xbox)




Papadopoulos, et al.     Expires August 5, 2019                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           PAW use cases scenarios           February 2019


   o  Public address, media and emergency systems at large venues
      (airports, stadiums, train stations, churches, theme parks).

   Today the ProAV applications are moving towards packet-based
   technology to introduce routing features and to reduce costs.

2.2.  Specificities

   Considering the uninterrupted audio or video stream, a potential
   packet losses during the transmission of audio or video flows cannot
   be tackled by re-trying the transmission, as it is done with file
   transfer, because by the time the packet lost has been identified it
   is too late to proceed with packet re-transmission.

2.3.  Asks for PAW

3.  Amusement Parks

3.1.  Use Case Description

   The digitalization of Amusement Parks is expected to decrease
   significantly the cost for maintaining the attractions.  By
   monitoring in real-time the machines, predictive maintenance will
   help to reduce the repairing cost as well as the downtime.  Besides,
   the attractions may use wireless transmissions to interconnect
   sensors and actuators, to privileged reconfigurability, and
   standardization.

   Using wireless devices also aim to enable novel high-value services.
   VIP tickets are nowadays more and more popular.  Wireless wearable
   devices may help to reduce the operating costs [disney-VIP] and
   increasing the number of charged services provided to the audience
   (VIP tickets, interactions, etc.)

3.2.  Specificities

   Amusement parks comprise a variable number of attractions, mostly
   outdoor.  The tourists are free to move from an attraction to
   another, covering a large geographical area.

   We make a distinction between the wireless devices which control the
   attractions, and the wearable devices owned by the visitors.  The
   park may "guide" the different users according to the attractions'
   attendance, waiting time, preferences of the users, distance of the
   attraction.

3.3.  Applications

   Tourist attractions may comprise a large set of sensors and
   actuators, which react in real time.  Typical applications (ordered
   by criticality in descending order) are:

   o  emergency: safety has to be preserved, and MUST stop the
      attraction when a failure is detected;

   o  real-time control: real-time applications embedded in the
      attraction need to trigger an action when an event is detected.
      For instance, a photograph can be taken when a car crosses an
      actuator, combined with a wireless ID that the tourists wear;

   o  predictive maintenance: statistics are collected to predict the
      future failures, or to compute later more complex statistics about
      the attraction's usage, the downtime, its popularity, etc.
