<section title="Introduction">
    <t>
        This draft describes industrial use cases which require deterministic flows over 
        wireless multi-hop paths.
    </t>

	<t>
    	The PAW use cases explicitly do not propose or suggest any specific solution or 
    	design for PAW architecture or protocols. 
    	These are subjects of other PAW drafts.
    	The PAW use cases are not considered as concrete requirements by the PAW Working 
    	Group.
	</t>
    
	<t>
    	The industrial use cases covered in this draft are professional audio, wireless 
    	for industrial applications and amusement parks.

   			The professional audio and video industry ("ProAV") includes:

                    Public address, media and emergency systems at large venues (airports,

   			Today the ProAV applications are moving to packet-based technology

<section title="Amusement Parks">
   
   <section title="Use Case Description">
   		<t> The digitalization of Amusement Parks is expected to decrease significantly
       		the cost for maintaining the attractions. By monitoring in real-time
       		the machines, predictive maintenance will help to reduce the repairing cost
       		as well as the downtime. Besides, the attractions may use wireless
       		transmissions to interconnect sensors and actuators, to privileged
       		reconfigurability, and standardization.
   		</t>
   
   		<t> Using wireless devices also aim to enable novel high-value services.
       		VIP tickets are nowadays more and more popular. Wireless wearable devices
       		may help to reduce the operating costs <xref target="disney-VIP"/> and
       		increasing the number of charged services provided to the audience (VIP
       		tickets, interactions, etc.)
   		</t>
   </section>    
   
   
   <section title="Specificities">
   	   		       
       <t> Amusement parks comprise a variable number of attractions, mostly outdoor.
           The tourists are free to move from an attraction to another, covering a large
           geographical area.
       </t>
       
       <t> We make a distinction between the wireless devices which control the attractions,
           and the wearable devices owned by the visitors. The park may "guide" the
           different users according to the attractions' attendance, waiting time,
           preferences of the users, distance of the attraction.
       </t>
    </section>
       
       
   <section title="Applications">
       
       <t> Tourist attractions may comprise a large set of sensors and actuators, which
           react in real time. Typical applications (ordered by criticality in
           descending order) are:
       </t>
       <t>
           <list style="symbols">
               <t>emergency: safety has to be preserved, and MUST stop the attraction
                   when a failure is detected;</t>
               
               <t>real-time control: real-time applications embedded in the attraction
                   need to trigger an action when an event is detected. For instance, a
                   photograph can be taken when a car crosses an actuator, combined
                   with a wireless ID that the tourists wear;</t>
               
               <t>predictive maintenance: statistics are collected to predict the
                   future failures, or to compute later more complex statistics about
                   the attraction's usage, the downtime, its popularity, etc. </t>
