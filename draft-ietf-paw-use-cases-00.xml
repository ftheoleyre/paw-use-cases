   The wireless medium presents significant specific challenges to achieve
   properties similar to those of wired deterministic networks. At the same
   time, a number of use cases cannot be solved with wires and justify the
   extra effort of going wireless. This document presents some of these

<section title="Introduction">

    <t>
    Based on time, resource reservation, and policy enforcement by distributed 
	shapers, Deterministic Networking provides the capability to carry
	specified unicast or multicast data streams for real-time applications with
	extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency, so as to support
	time-sensitive and mission-critical applications on a converged enterprise
	infrastructure.  
	</t>
	<t>
    Deterministic Networking technology allows new Quality of Service (QoS)
	guarantees of worst-case delivery.  More precisely, the worst-case data
    latency can be guaranteed for a bounded throughput in a consistent fashion
	as multiple	services are deployed, augmenting the load of the network with
	no measurable impact on existing flows whatsoever. Additional QoS goals can
	include a bounded loss ratio or a maximum losses in a row like three
	consecutive losses at a maximum.
	</t>
	<t>
	Key attributes of Deterministic Networking are:
       <list style="symbols">
     <t>time synchronization on all the nodes;</t> 
	 <t>the centralized computation of network-wide deterministic paths;</t>
	 <t>new traffic shapers within and at the edge to protect the network;</t>
     <t>specialized hardware for scheduled access to the media.</t>
	   </list>
	</t>
    <t>
	Achieving Determinism requires a tight control of the physical resources, 
	and at the physical level, the wireless and wired media are fundamentally
	different. Wireless operates in a shared medium, and the quality of the 
	transmission is fuzzy, depending on variables in the time, space and
	frequency domains. 
	</t>
    <t>
	It results that while the generic Problem Statement
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-problem-statement"/> for DetNet applies to
	the wireless medium as well as to wires, the methods to achieve Predictable
	and Available Wireless (PAW) communications will necessarily differ from
	those used to support Time-Sensitive Networks in the wired environment.
	</t>
	<t>
	So far, Open Standards for Deterministic Networking have prevalently been
	focused on wired media, with Audio/Video Bridging (AVB) and Time Sensitive
	Networking (TSN) at the IEEE and DetNet <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture"/> at the IETF. But wires cannot be used in
	a number of cases, including mobile or rotating	devices, rehabilitated 
	industrial buildings, wearable or in-body sensory devices, vehicle 
	automation and	multiplayer	gaming.
	</t>
	<t>
	Purpose-built wireless technologies such as <xref target="ISA100"/>, which
    incorporates IPv6, were developped and deployed to cope for the lack of open
	standards, but they yield a high cost in OPEX and CAPEX and are limited to
	very few industries, e.g., process control, concert instruments or racing. 
	</t>
	<t>
	This is now changing:
	<list style="symbols">
	   <t>IMT-2020 has recognized Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication
	   (URLLC) as a key functionality for the upcoming 5G,</t>
	   <t>IEEE 802.11 is integrating real-time applications in the charter of
	   the	Extreme High Throughput (EHT) Task Group (to be formed at the time
	   of this writing), and</t>
	   <t>the IETF has designed an IPv6 stack <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/> for IEEE Std. 802.15.4
	   TimeSlotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) and an architecture that enables 
	   Predictable and Available Wireless (PAW) communications on a shared MAC.

	</t>
    <t>
    This draft extends the <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases">
	"Deterministic Networking Use Cases"</xref> and describes a number of
	additional use cases which require deterministic flows over wireless links
	and possibly complex multi-hop paths.

<section title="Wireless for Industrial Applications">
   
   <section title="Use Case Description">
   <t> 
   A major use case for networking in Industrial is the control networks where 
   periodic control loops operate between a sensor that measures a physical 
   property such as the temperature of a fluid, a Programmable Logic
   Controller that decides an action such as warm up the mix, and an actuator
   that performs the required action, e.g., inject power in a resistor.
   </t>
		
   </section>    
   
   
   <section anchor="indusspecif" title="Specificities">    
   <section anchor="indusloops" title="Control Loops">     
 
   <t>
   Process Control designates continous processing operations, e.g., heating
   Oil in a refinery or mixing drinking soda. Control loops in the Process
   Control industry operate at a very low rate, typically 4 times per second.
   Factory Automation, on the other hand, deal with discrete goods such as
   individual automobile parts, and requires faster loops, in the order of 10ms.
   Motion control that monitors dynamic activities may require even faster rates in the order of a few ms. Finally, some industries exhibit hybrid 
   behaviours, like canned soup that will start as a process industry while 
   mixing the food and then operate as a discrete manufacturing when putting
   the final product in cans and shipping them. 
   </t>
   <t>
   In all those cases, a packet must flow deterministically between the sensor
   and the PLC, be processed by the PLC, and sent to the actuator within the
   control loop period. In some particular use cases that inherit from analog
   operations, jitter might also alter the operation of the control loop. 
   A rare packet loss is usually admissible, but typically 4 losses in a row
   will cause an emergency halt of the production and incur a high cost for
   the manufacturer.
   </t> 
   </section><!--"Control Loops"-->
   
   <section anchor="indusdiags" title="Unmeasured Data">   
   <t>
   A secondary use case deals with monitoring and diagnostics. This so-called unmeasured data is essential to improve the performances of a production
   line, e.g., by optimizing real-time processing or maintenance windows using
   Machine Learning predictions. For the lack of wireless technologies, some
   specific industries such as Oil and Gas have been using serial cables,
   literally by the millions, to perform their process optimization over the
   previous decades. But few industries would afford the associated cost and
   the Holy Grail of the Industrial Internet of Things is to provide the same
   benefits to all industries, including SmartGrid, Transportation, Building,
   Commercial and Medical. This requires a cheap, available and scalable
   IP-based access technology.
   </t>

   <t>
   Inside the factory, wires may already be available to operate the Control
   Network. But unmeasured data are not welcome in that network for a number of
   reasons. On the one hand it is rich and asynchronous, meaning that using they
   may influence the deterministic nature of the control operations and impact
   the production. On the other hand, this information must be reported to the
   carpeted floor over IP, which means the potential for a security breach via
   the interconnection of the Operational Technology (OT) network with the
   Internet technology (IT) network and possibly enable a rogue access.

   <section title="The Need for Wireless"> 
   <t>
   Ethernet cables used on a robot arm are prone to breakage after a few
   thousands flexions, a lot faster than a power cable that is wider inn diameter, and more resilient. In general, wired networking and mobile parts
   are not a good match, mostly in the case of fast and recurrent activities, as
   well as rotation.
   </t>
   <t>
   When refurbishing older premises that were built before the Internet age,
   power is usually available everywhere, but data is not. It is often 
   impractical, time consuming and expensive to deploy an Ethernet fabric
   across walls and between buildings. Deploying a wire may take months and
   cost tens of thousands of US Dollars.
   </t>
   <t>
   Even when wiring exists, e.g., in an existing control network, asynchronous
   IP packets such as diagnostics may not be welcome for operational and
   security reasons (see <xref target="indusloops" />). An alternate network
   that can scale with the many sensors and actuators that equip every robot, 
   every valve and fan that are deployed on the factory floor and may help 
   detect and prevent a failure that could impact the production.
   IEEE Std. 802.15.4 Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH)
   <xref target="RFC7554"/> is a promising technology for that purpose, mostly
   if the scheduled operations enable to use the same network by asynchronous
   and deterministic flows in parallel.   
   </t>
   
   
   
   </section> <!-- title="The Need for Wireless" --> 
	
   <section title="Asks for PAW">     
	<t>
	As stated by the <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-problem-statement">
	"Deterministic Networking Problem Statement" </xref>, a Deterministic
	Network is backwards compatible with (capable of transporting) statistically
	multiplexed traffic while preserving the properties of the accepted
	deterministic flows. While the <xref target="I-D.ietf-6tisch-architecture"/>
	serves that requirement, the work at 6TiSCH was focused on best-effort IPv6
	packet flows. PAW should be able to lock so-called hard cells for use by a
	centralized scheduler, and program so-called end-to-end Tracks over those
	cells.
	</t>
    <t> 
	Over the course of the recent years, major Industrial Protocols, e.g.,
	<xref target="ODVA"/> with EtherNet/IP <xref target="EIP"/> and
	<xref target="Profinet"/>, have been migrating towards Ethernet and IP.
	In order to unleash the full power of the IP hourglass model, it should be
	possible to deploy any application over any network that has the physical
	capacity to transport the industrial flow, regardless of the MAC/PHY
	technology, wired or wireless, and across technologies. 
	PAW should be able to setup a Track over a wireless access segment such as
	TSCH and a backbone segment such as Ethernet or WI-Fi, to report a sensor
	data or a critical monitoring within a bouded latency.
